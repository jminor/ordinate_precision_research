# Ordinate Precision Research

## Overview

A series of tests to explore floating point accuracy over large number ranges.

## Falsifiable Hypothesis

Attempting to prove that a rational with an integer component is necessary to
maintain precision over large time scales and under math.

## Methodology

Construct double precision values that fail precision tests thus requiring an
integer rational.
